Q: Why not patch GNU-EFI for clang support?
	Wanted to learn the internals of UEFI in a way that was very clear.
	(Also because licensing, not 256% sure "THIS IS ALL BSD LICENSED" so I'd rather not.)

Q: Why version 2.7? Doesn't your test hardware only support 2.5?
	I plan to get a new machine powered by Team Red's Zen CPU soon, which would have 2.7
	most likely. Waypoint's EFISTUB will avoid any super advanced features anyway.

Q: Will programs intended to compile against GNU-EFI work on libre-efi?
	Possibly, possibly not. No idea.

Q: Is it "libre-efi", "LIBRE-EFI", or "Libre-EFI"?
	It doesn't really matter to me.

Q: Why isn't this called "FreedomEFI"?
	Because that would be putting too much "FreedomX" into everything where it doesn't matter.
	FreedomX should be for things on Waypoint, not for things like this.
