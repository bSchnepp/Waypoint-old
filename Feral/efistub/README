This directory contains EFISTUB stuff.
This is necessary in order to boot the kernel until FeralBoot is done, in which case this will be deprecated.

It uses the libre-efi library, which I'l also developing to do this (avoid GNU-EFI)
You may take libre-efi out and use it for your own projects.
libre-efi is licensed under the zlib license, reproduced below (again) for clarity.
