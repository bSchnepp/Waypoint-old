For absolute clarity, creating userspace programs that use the kernel through it's system calls is considered NORMAL USE of this program.
Distributing programs which use the kernel through this intended purpose are NOT considered as 'Larger Works' and can be distributed freely.
You do NOT need to ship a copy of Waypoint (or it's source code) along with your userspace programs.

Anything that goes into the kernel however, IS a Larger Work (when redistributed), such as (kernel-space) filesystems, device drivers, etc.
Again, the terms of the MPL apply there. See 'LICENSE' for the exact terms.
