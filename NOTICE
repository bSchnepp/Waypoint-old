For absolite clarity, creating userspace programs that use the kernel through it's system calls, or through the library provided to create Waypoint programs 
are considered as NORMAL USE of the program.
You do not need to ship a copy of Waypoint or it's source code along with your userspace programs.

Programs that are included into the kernel (typically drivers) are larger works. 
See 'LICENSE' for the exact terms.
